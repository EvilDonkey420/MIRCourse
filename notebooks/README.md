# Notebooks for the MIR course

This folder contains the Jupyter notebooks organized in the way it is planned to be presented in the actual course.

As the course targets hands-on practice, for (almost) each task there are two versions available:

- A student version where some parts of the code is left for the student to fill in. These parts are marked with: "Your code starts here" .... "Your code ends here"

- The complete version (which includes one of the many possible implementations for the expected part)

As part of their course work, every students was expected to create a similar notebook. These notebooks are gathered under the 'studentNotebooks' folder here.
